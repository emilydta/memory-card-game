# memory-card-game

A game where you can't click on the same colour twice! Built with React/CRA.

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/

<h2>Reflection</h2>

Completing this project has taught me:

  - How to use the useEffect hook to mimic class-component lifecycle methods (componendDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).
  - A little about CSS keyframe animations.
